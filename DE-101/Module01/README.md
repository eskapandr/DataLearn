# Module 1 - Homework

## 1. Analytic Solution Architecture

Our first task in this module was to draw the top-level architecture of the analytic solution using draw.io or similar tools

Architecture should have three layers:

- Storage Layer - data storage layer
- Business Layer - layer for access to data of business users

As a possible example, I chose an AI-based image generation service (a mobile and web service) developed by a startup team.
 
 Below is my solution:
