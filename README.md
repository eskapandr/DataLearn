# Getting Started with Analytics and Data Engineering (DE-101) 
## Course by DataLearn
## Intro

Hi, I'm Andrey, an experienced project manager in IT-education and my current goal is to move into the field of data analytics.

My methods of developing analytical skills vary from studying various courses, reading articles and documentation to watching tutorials on YouTube and using chatGPT prompts. But since I found Data Learn courses, they seem to be one of the best free sources to enter the magical world of data-related professions :)

The current repository is for my DE-101 course assignments.

I commit from my local machine and use Visual Studio and Windows Git Bash.
