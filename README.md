Hi, I am Andrey, experienced educational project manager, currently work in IT-education but have a strong intension to switch to data analyst.

I've been learning data analytics in many different ways (online courses, blended programs, self-paced learning) and Data Learn courses seems to me one of the best free sources to enter the magic world of data jobs:)
