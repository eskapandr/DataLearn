# Getting Started with Analytics and Data Engineering (DE-101) 
## Course by DataLearn
## Intro

Hi, I'm Andrey, an experienced educational project manager, currently working in IT-education, but have a strong intention to switch to data analytics.

I've been studying data analytics in different ways (online courses, blended programs, self-study), and Data Learn courses seem to me one of the best free sources to enter the magical world of data-related professions :)

This is the repository for my assignments in Data Learn's Getting Started with Analytics and Data Engineering (DE-101) course.

I commit to this repository from my local machine and use Visual Studio and Windows Git Bash to do so.
