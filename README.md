# Getting Started with Analytics and Data Engineering (DE-101) 
## Course by DataLearn
## Intro

Hi, I'm Andrey, currently work in IT-education as a project manager and have a strong intention to switch to data analytics.

My methods to build up analytical hard skills varies -  from learning different cources, reading articles and documentation to watching YouTube manuals and prompting chatGPT. But since I have found Data Learn courses they seem to me one of the best free sources to enter the magical world of data-related professions :)

Current repository is for my assignments in DE-101 course.

I commit from my local machine and use Visual Studio and Windows Git Bash.
